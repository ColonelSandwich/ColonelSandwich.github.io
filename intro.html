          <h2 class="text-center">What IS a "Super Scaler?"</h2>

          <p>This may be fairly obvious for you, but video games didn't always look as good as they do now! Many games
            these days use very complex 3D rendering tools and technologies that developers from the 80's and 90's could
            merely dream of using.</p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of The Last of Us 2." src='Pictures/tlou2.jpg'>
          <div class='imagetext'>Screenshot of Naughty Dog's <span class='italic'>The Last of Us 2</span> on the PS4 Pro. Two decades ago, you'd
            need a dedicated CG
            workstation to get visuals this good!</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>Today, scenes in video games can be made up of millions of <u>polygons</u> at once. Back then however,
            <u>CG</u> rendering was still in its infancy. Often 3D games were made using <u>vector</u> wireframe
            graphics, in which only the lines between points were drawn. This was much easier to process than having
            filled in polygons, since polygon filling was a rather slow and costly task for technology of that era.
            Filled-in polygons also need to be sorted or <u>culled</u> in order to make sure that objects farther away
            don't overlap with objects closer to the screen (also a very costly task!). This made vectors excellent for
            early 3D video games, but weren't exactly very attractive to look at!
          </p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Atari's Battlezone." src='Pictures/bzone_a.png'>
          <div class='imagetext'>Atari's <span class='italic'>Battlezone</span> from 1980. Primitive, but an effective representation of a 3D world using
            wireframe objects.</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>Alongside vector graphics displays were <u>raster graphics</u>, which were designed to show images using a
            grid of pixels rather than a series of lines. Games using raster displays were built with two <u>bitmap</u>
            images. One such type of these images were known as <u>sprites</u>, which were bitmap graphics that could be
            displayed independently from the <u>frame buffer</u>. This meant that they could be easily moved around
            without the need for the entire screen to refresh, and made them perfect for moving objects such as players,
            enemies, and projectiles.</p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Super Mario Bros." src='Pictures/NES_Super_Mario_Bros.png'>
          <div class='imagetext'>The omnipresent <span class='italic'>Super Mario Bros.</span> from 1985. Mario, the Goombas, fireball, coin and
            starman in this scene are all sprites. The static elements like the clouds, ground, and bushes are
            background elements made up of tiles.</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>For a time (around the late 70's to the mid 80's) games using vector displays AND raster displays
            co-existed. The former had the advantage of being easy to scale and rotate, since vector graphics were
            literally made up of lines between points. Raster graphics had the advantage of being far more flexible and
            attractive than early vector displays, since they could render 2D images with full color.
          <p>

            <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Marble Madness." src='Pictures/marble_a.png'>
          <div class='imagetext'>Atari's <span class='italic'>Marble Madness</span> from 1984. Programmed by a young Mark Cerny, the game is notable
            for its impressive 3D look comprised of isometric 2D images.</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>By 1985, the writing was on the wall for the prominence of vector displays in gaming. Their primitive
            nature compared against the more colorful and full images that could be produced by raster games of the time
            meant that they gradually faded away. But now what? This now meant that games with a convincing 3D effect
            would be harder to achieve, since full polygonal 3D wasn't quite in the cards yet! Could sprites somehow
            fill in the void left behind by the absence of 3D vector graphics?</p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Atari's Empire Strikes Back arcade game." src='Pictures/esb.png'>
          <div class='imagetext'>Atari's <span class='italic'>Empire Strikes Back</span> arcade game from 1985. Pretty late for a vector based
            game... look at those AT-ATs!!</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>Actually.... yeah! They kinda COULD!</p></br></br>

          <p>Drawing a sprite at this point was quite easy for hardware to do. If the hardware supported the ability to
            draw the image at different sizes, you could create a failry convincing 3D effect just by drawing sprites at
            different scales! Sprites closer to the screen could be scaled larger while sprites farther away from the
            screen could be scaled smaller! Such was the case with Sega's <span class='italic'>Turbo</span> from 1981, possibly the earliest example
            of a game that used sprites drawn at different sizes to replicate a 3D look. Namco's <span class='italic'>Pole Position</span> followed
            suit a year later, using sprites and <u>scanline</u> effects to draw a convincing 3D environment made up of
            a road, other drivers, and several roadside objects such as signs and billboards.</p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Namco's Pole Position." src='Pictures/poleposa.png'>
          <div class='imagetext'>Namco's <span class='italic'>Pole Position</span> from 1982. A pretty smooth looking game, especially for its time.
          </div>

          </br></br>

          <p>These kinds of sprite based 3D games didn't really take off in popularity until around 1985, when Yu Suzuki
            produced both <span class='italic'>Space Harrier</span> and <span class='italic'>Hang-On</span> for Sega. While they used the same techniques as the aformentioned
            <span class='italic'>Turbo</span> and <span class='italic'>Pole Position</span>, the graphics hardware had advanced enough to visually blow both of them out of the
            water. Not only were they visually stunning to look at, but both games were also FAST due to the relative
            simplicity of only having to draw sprites at different sizes rather than objects made up of several
            polygons. Many other companies took notice to these new "scaler" type games and began producing their own.
          </p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Space Harrier." src='Pictures/sharrier_a.png'>
          <div class='imagetext'>Sega's <span class='italic'>Space Harrier</span> from 1985. Yu Suzuki's rail shooter masterpiece! Moai heads!!
          </div>

          </br></br>

          <p>And thus, a new age was born..... the <u>SUPER SCALER</u> age!!</p></br></br>

          <p>So then, what IS a "Super Scaler?" The term refers to the computer graphics technique of using sprites and
            scanline effects to reproduce a 3D looking effect. Many games in the years following would use the effect
            due to the hardware and technology for it being far more readily available than for polygon-based 3D. Even
            with the advent of new polygonal 3D games such as Namco's <span class='italic'>Winning Run</span> in 1988 and Atari's <span class='italic'>Hard Drivin'</span> in
            1989, Super Scalers still had their place thanks to their speed and visual fidelity. Super Scalers would
            continue to be used in games both in arcades and on home consoles for several more years...</p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Namco's Winning Run." src='Pictures/winningrun.jpg'>
          </br>
          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Super Monaco GP." src='Pictures/smgp_a.png'>

          <div class='imagetext'>Comparison between Namco's <span class='italic'>Winning Run</span> from '88 (top) and Sega's <span class='italic'>Super Monaco GP from '89</span>. The latter moves a lot smoother and is more vibrant, however the former was more impressive for its time.</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>...however, much like vector based games before it, Sprite Based 3D would eventually become outdated thanks
            to advancements in polygonal 3D technology. Games like Namco's <span class='italic'>Ridge Racer</span> in 1993 and Sega's <span class='italic'>Daytona USA</span> in
            1994 both had full 3D with <u>texture-mapped</u> polygons running at a blazing fast 60 <u>frames per
              second</u>; on par with most Super Scalers at the time! And thus, 1995 would be the last hurrah for Super
            Scaler titles in the arcades, with polygonal 3D becoming far more accessible for developers and also being
            more expected from consumers who came to arcades for graphics they couldn't get on home consoles.</p>

<img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Sega Rally Championship." src='Pictures/segarally_c.jpg'>
        </br>
          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Capcom's Slipstream." src='Pictures/slipstream_a.png'>

          <div class='imagetext'><span class='italic'>Sega Rally Championship</span> (top) and Capcom's <span class='italic'>Slipstream</span> (bottom), both released in 1995. While Slipstream looks fantastic, you can't deny how far polygonal 3D had come in just 7 years!</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>Super Scalers weren't dead though! In fact, for lower fidelity hardware such as Nintendo's Game Boy line of
            handhelds or early Java-based phones. Even today, modern developers are still creating throwbacks to these
            old types of games. Why? Perhaps it's the way that Super Scalers had to "exaggerate" 3D space in order to
            look more appealing, and seeing how a 3D world can be made up out of 2D images used in creative ways still
            manages to impress to this day!</p>

          <img class='center' alt="Screenshot of Ansdor's Slipstream!" src='Pictures/slipstream.jpg'>

          <div class='imagetext'>Ansdor's <span class='italic'>Slipstream</span>, released in 2018. It's like poetry: it rhymes!</div>

          </br></br>

          <p>Super Scalers may not by mainstream anymore, but they will never die out completely. Long live "SUPER
            SCALERS!!"</p></br></br></br></br></br></br>
